#  Recursion methods in Ruby - warmups

Created in Ruby.
- digit_sum.rb - a recursive method sumdigRecursive takes an integer and returns the sum of its digits, for instance sumdigRecursive(103) returns 4.
- factorial_sum.rb - method factorialRecursive takes a number and returns the factorial for that number, while iterative method factorialIterative does the same, but iteratively.
- palindrome.rb - returns true if a given string is a palindrome.
